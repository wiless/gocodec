gocodec
=======

A simple code for decoding RIFF header from wave file



Example
========
```bash
cd wiless/gocodec/example
go build testriff.go
./testriff
```

*Note* 
You need to have the wav file in the same folder 

Background
=========
I wrote the code to learn more about reading and parsing the byte fields in the header of the wav file.
